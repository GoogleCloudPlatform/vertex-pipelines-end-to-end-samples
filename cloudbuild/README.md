# CI/CD pipelines

## Overview

There are four CI/CD pipelines

1. `pr-checks.yaml` - runs pre-commit checks and unit tests on the custom KFP components, and checks that the ML pipelines (training and prediction) can compile.
1. `release.yaml` - compiles training and prediction pipelines, then copies the compiled pipelines and their respective "assets" folders to GCS destinations in the test and prod environments.
3. `terraform-plan.yaml` - Checks the Terraform configuration under `envs/<env>` (i.e. `envs/test` or `envs/prod`), and produces a summary of any proposed changes that will be applied on merge to the main branch. Out of the box, this just includes Cloud Scheduler jobs used to schedule your ML pipelines.
4. `terraform-apply.yaml` - Applies the Terraform configuration under `envs/<env>` (i.e. `envs/test` or `envs/prod`). Out of the box, this just includes Cloud Scheduler jobs used to schedule your ML pipelines.

The last two assume you have already set up your infrastructure separately (GCS buckets, service accounts, IAM, Pub/Sub topic, and Cloud Function). If not, you can use the Terraform modules under [`terraform/modules`](../terraform) to do this.

## Setting up the CI/CD pipelines

See the [Google Cloud Documentation](https://cloud.google.com/build/docs/automating-builds/create-manage-triggers) for details on how to link your repository to Cloud Build, and set up triggers.

## Variable substitutions

Below is a table detailing the variable substitutions you will need to set up in your triggers:

| Variable name                 | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | Example value                                                            |

## Recommended triggers

### On Pull Request to `main` / `master` branch

Set up a trigger for the `pr-checks.yaml` pipeline, and provide a substitution value for the variable `_PIPELINE_TEMPLATE` (either `xgboost` or `tensorflow`).

Set up two triggers for `terraform-plan.yaml`:
  - One for the test environment. Set the substitution value for the variable `_ENV_DIRECTORY` to `envs/test`.
  - One for the prod environment. Set the substitution value for the variable `_ENV_DIRECTORY` to `envs/prod`.

### On push of new tag

Set up a trigger for the `release.yaml` pipeline, and provide substitution values for the following variables (described in the table above):

- `_PIPELINE_PUBLISH_GCS_PATH`
- `_PIPELINE_TEMPLATE`
- `_TEST_PAYLOAD`
- `_TEST_VERTEX_CMEK_IDENTIFIER` (optional)
- `_TEST_VERTEX_LOCATION`
- `_TEST_VERTEX_NETWORK` (optional)
- `_TEST_VERTEX_PIPELINE_ROOT`
- `_TEST_VERTEX_PROJECT_ID`
- `_TEST_VERTEX_SA_EMAIL`

### On merge to `main` / `master` branch

Set up two triggers for `terraform-apply.yaml`:
  - One for the test environment. Set the substitution value for the variable `_ENV_DIRECTORY` to `envs/test`.
  - One for the prod environment. Set the substitution value for the variable `_ENV_DIRECTORY` to `envs/prod`.
